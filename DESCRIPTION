Description: This package generates and evaluates synthetic survey data.
    It can simulate responses based on real respondents profiles, create
    synthetic respondents and datasets that mirror the structure and
    distributions of real data, and generate multiple synthetic data
    variations. Additional features include weighting synthetic
    respondents, quality checks, and synthetic data tuning.
