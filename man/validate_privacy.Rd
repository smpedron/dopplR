\title{Check Similarity Between Real and Synthetic Data}
\usage{
validate_privacy(real_data, synthetic_data, threshold = 0.4, tolerance = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{real_data}{Original dataset.}

\item{synthetic_data}{Synthetic dataset.}

\item{threshold}{Proportion of overlap that triggers a flag.}

\item{tolerance}{Defines how close a synthetic value can be to a real value to count as overlapping.}
}
\value{
A list summarizing each variable, including:
\item{overlap_prop} proportion of synthetic values that are exact (or near) copies of real values.
\item{flagged: True} column has too many copies (above the threshold) and might leak real data.
\item{flagged: False} synthetic values are sufficiently different (based on threshold).
}
\description{
For confidential data: evaluates the degree to which synthetic data matches exact values or is very close to the original data.
This can help identify columns where synthetic data may be too similar to real respondents, which could risk disclosure.

\examples{
structure <- describe_structure(mtcars)
synth <- generate_synthetic_sample(n = 2, structure = structure, prompt = "Simulate realistic car performance data with similar distributions.")
validate_privacy(mtcars, synth)
