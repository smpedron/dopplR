\title{Weight Synthetic Respondents to Match Target Marginals}
\usage{
weight_synth(synth_data, target_margins, vars, replacement = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{synth_data}{A data frame of synthetic respondents to be re-weighted.}

\item{target_margins}{A list or data frame specifying the desired marginal distributions for each variable.}

\item{vars}{A character vector of variable names in \code{synth_data} to match to the target marginals.}

\item{replacement}{Logical: if \code{TRUE}, allows sampling with replacement when adjusting weights. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same rows as \code{synth_data}, with an additional column of weights reflecting the target margins.
}
\description{
Adjusts the weights of synthetic respondents so that the marginal distributions of specified variables align with a target population.
Weights are normalized.

synth_data <- data.frame(
  age = c(25, 35, 45, 30, 22, 41, 33),

  gender = c("M" = 0.5, "F" = 0.5))
